Functions much like shadertoy

### Goals:
- header file with the basic types, functions, and defines for simple GLSL style shaders
- Implement a shadertoy style interface.

### Examples:
- twinkle; spots appear and fade over time
- snow; spots fall down the screen
- matrix; classic letter-rain effect
